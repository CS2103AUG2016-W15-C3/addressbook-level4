#### Editing a task : `edit`
You can use the `edit` command to edit any parts of a task. <br>

Format: 
`edit` INDEX [<i>st:</i> NEW_START_TIME] [<i>et:</i> NEW_END_TIME] [<i>desc:</i> NEW_DESCRIPTION] [<i>sd:</i> NEW_START_DATE] [<i>ed:</i> NEW_END_DATE] [<i>p:</i> NEW_PRIORITY] 
<br><p align="center"><img src="images/screenshots/editCmd.png" width="800"></br>
Figure 3: Edits the third task on the list<br>

Entering "`edit` 3 <i>desc:</i> send all emails <i>sd:</i> 11-11-2016 <i>ed:</i> 12-11-2016 <i>st:</i> 3pm <i>et:</i> 4pm <i>p:</i> 3", will update description to 'send all emails', start date to '11-11-2016', end date to '12-11-2016', start time to '3pm' end time to '4pm' and priority to '3'.<br>

> Take Note! <br>
> * You only need to key in the necessary parameters of the task you would like to change. Not all parameters are required.
> * Order of the parameters is not important.
> * Editing of overdue tasks will result in both the  date and time to be set to the default values, unless otherwise stated.
