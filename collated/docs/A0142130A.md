### History Component

<p align="center">
<img src="images/HistoryClassDiagram.png" width="500"><br>

<em>Diagram 11: History Class Diagram </em>
</p>

The diagram above gives an overview of how the `History` component is implemented.<br>
<br>**API** : [`History.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskell/model/History.java)

The `History` component,
* stores the commands that UndoCommand can execute (add/delete/done/undone/edit)
* exposes list of command input strings for UI display
* updates list of command history every time a command is executed

```
###### \DeveloperGuide.md
``` md

#### Use case: Undo command

**MSS**

1. User enters a command
2. Taskell executes it
3. User requests to view undo commands history
4. User requests to undo command at specific index
5. Taskell reverts the command <br>
Use case ends

**Extensions**

3a. The user did not enter any previous command

> 3a1. Taskell shows a message indicating no commands available for undo<br>

4a. The user enters invalid index

> 4a1. Taskell shows error message indicating index is invalid<br>

```

#### Use case: View calendar for the week

**MSS**

1. User requests to view calendar
2. Taskell displays calendar
  
#### Use case: Save data to specified folder

**MSS**

1. User requests to save all tasks
2. Taskell saves all tasks in the requested folder <br>
Use case ends

**Extensions**

1a. User gives invalid filename (contains illegal symbols not allowed in file names)

> 1a1. Taskell shows an error message and still saves data in previous old location.<br>

2a. Data cannot be written to the requested folder (invalid directory or access prohibited)

> 2a1. Taskell shows an error message and still saves data in previous old location.<br>

#### Use case: Clear task

**MSS**

1. User requests to clear all tasks
2. Taskell shows pop-up to ask for confirmation
3. User confirms
4. Taskell deletes all tasks
Use case ends

**Extensions**

3a. User cancels request

> 3a1. Taskell does not clear all tasks <br>

#### Remember the Milk
**Pros:**<br>
1. Can be used offline and tasks are synced once internet connection is established<br>
2. Can handle some natural languages processing by saving deadlines from task information itself (e.g. Do math homework tomorrow: Saves task with deadline set to tomorrow)<br>
3. Can undo when marking tasks as done (recover from accidentally marking a task as done)<br>
4. Can set priority, and list tasks by priority<br>
5. Can set recursive tasks<br>

**Cons:**<br>
1. Need to click frequently to enter or edit a task<br>
2. Need to remember lots of shortcuts, so user is less likely to use them<br>
3. Has a cluttered interface, which is not intuitive<br>
4. Does not support calendar view in-house<br>

#### Finding tasks: `find`
You can use the `find` command to view tasks with specific keywords.<br> 

Formats: <br>
- `find` KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]<br>
Displays a list of tasks with description or tags matching all the keywords.<br>
Example: `find` banana milk essay<br>
Displays a list of all the tasks with description or tags matching 'banana', 'milk', and 'essay'. <br>

> Take Note! <br>
> Tasks with words that match the keyword include those that contain the keyword. For example, searching for 'book' will match with 'book', 'textbook', 'storybook' etc.

- `find-tag` TAG [MORE_TAGS]<br>
Displays list of tasks with the same tags.<br>
Example: `find-tag` homework essay cs2103<br>
Displays a list of tasks having tagged as either 'homework', 'essay', or 'cs2103'.
 <br><p align="center"><img src="images/screenshots/find_cs2010_results.png" width="800"></br> <br>
Figure 4: `find` CS2010 displays a list of tasks with 'CS2010' as one of the keywords in task description

> Take Note! <br>
> * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. 'chicken egg' will match 'egg chicken'.
> * Tasks matching at least one keyword will be displayed.
    e.g. 'chicken' will match 'chicken duck'

#### Clearing all entries : `clear`
You can use the `clear` command to clear all task data permanently. <br>

Format: `clear`  

<p align="center"><img src="images/screenshots/clearCmd.png" width="800"></br>
Figure 9: `clear` prompts a confirmation pop-up window<br>

> Take note! <br>
> `clear` command is irreversible!

#### Showing history : `history` or `hist`
You can use the `history` command to view a list of actions that can be undone. The command history will be shown in the right panel..<br>

Format: `history` or `hist` 
<p align="center"><img src="images/screenshots/historyCmd.png" width="800"></br> <br>
Figure 10: `hist` displays the command history on the right panel

> Take note! <br>
> * Only commands that are available for undo will be shown here. 
> * Refer to the `undo` section below to find out which commands can be undone.

#### Reverting previous action : `undo`
You can use the `undo` command to undo your previous actions.

Formats: <br>
- `undo`<br> 
Undo the most recent command executed<br>
- `undo` INDEX<br> 
Undo the command at the specified index in the  command history.<br>
Example: `hist`, then `undo` 3, will undo the third command in the command history.
<p align="center"><img src="images/screenshots/undoCmd.png" width="800"></br>
Figure 11: `undo` reverts the last item in the command history

> Take note! <br>
> Undo command only supports `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `done`, `undone` and `undo` commands.

#### Showing calendar view : `calendar` or `cal`
You can use the `calendar` command to view a calendar. <br>

Format: `calendar` or `cal` <br>

You can refer to the calendar on the right panel when adding tasks and scheduling events. A fine red line is used to indicate the current time.
<br> <p align="center"> <img src="images/screenshots/calendarCmd.png" width="800"> </br>
Figure 12: Example of how the current time marker looks like<br>

The calendar view reflects the tasks shown in the left panel. Each block is marked with the index corresponding to the task, meaning a block marked '4' would correspond to the fourth task.<br>
By default, the calendar view will be shown on the right panel. As the `history` command also utilizes the right panel to display the command history, you have to use the `calendar` command to toggle between both views.<br>

> Take note! <br>
> Entering other commands (i.e. `find`, `add`) will revert the right panel back to the calendar view as it is the default view. <br>


#### Saving the information in Taskell : `save`
You can use the `save` command to specify the path of a folder to store Taskell's data file. Please note that you should have permissions to access the folder. <br>

Format: `save` FILE_PATH<br>
Example: `save` C:\Users\Jim\Documents
<br>

To obtain the file-path, navigate to the required file in your File Explorer. Copy the path at the top of the
screen and paste it into Taskell. Refer to the diagram below for an example of a file-path. <br>

<p align="center"> <img src="images/filepath_screenshot.png" width="1000"> </br>
Figure 13: Screenshot of File Explorer in Windows <br>

If the specified directory is valid but the folder is missing, for example, if you entered `save` C:\Users\Jim\Documents\Project,  and 'C:\Users\Jim\Documents\Project' is valid
but 'Project' folder has not been created, Taskell will create the folder for you.<br>


> Take note! <br>
> * If you only specify a folder name without directory, i.e. `save` project, Taskell will create a folder named 'project' within Taskell's own directory. 
>Whereas `save` C:/Users/Jim/Documents/project will open a folder named 'project' within your desktop's Documents folder.
> * Both Windows and Linux OS have restricted symbols that are not allowed for folder names. Please be aware of the symbols
shown in the table below.

**Q**: Do I have to save the data every time I enter new tasks? <br>
**A**: No, Taskell automatically saves your data every time you enter new tasks. Use `save` only when you want to
transfer your data to a new location on your computer. <br>
